Python API Challenge


## Part I - WeatherPy

This example contains a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, it uses a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

The first objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each plot add a sentence or two explains what the code is and analyzing.

The next objective is to run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots a short explaination on what the linear regression is modelling such as any relationships and any other analysis is added

The final notebook contains:

* Randomly select **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Performs a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
* Includes a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
* Saves a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.

### Part II - VacationPy

This examples uses the weather data to plan future vacations. Use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.

* **Note:** if you having trouble displaying the maps try running `jupyter nbextension enable --py gmaps` in your environment and retry.

This notebook

* Creates a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I.

* Narrows down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:

  * A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.

  * Wind speed less than 10 mph.

  * Zero cloudiness.

  * Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.

  * **Note:** Feel free to adjust to your specifications but be sure to limit the number of rows returned by your API requests to a reasonable number.

* Using Google Places API the code finds the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.

* Plots the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.
